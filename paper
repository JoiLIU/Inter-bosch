Key Contribution:

    Proposed a deep outlier detection framework named Transformation Invariant Autoencoder (TIAE) – simple but effective
    Derive an adaptive self-paced learning algorithm without extra hyper-parameters. – mitigate the negative effect of outliers in the process of feature learning.

Framwork

Transformations

    Spatial transformation(crop, resize..), appearance transformation(color dropping, brightness..)

    Transformations group is far better than single transformation

    Should erase specific information, much shared among inliers, little shared among outliers.

Model Architectures

Adaptive self-paced learning

‒Its core idea is to generally start with learning easier aspects of a task, then gradually consider more complex examples
